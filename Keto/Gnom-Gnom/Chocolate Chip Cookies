INGREDIENTS
1 1/4 cup almond flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
1 tablespoon konjac powder (i.e. glucomannan) arrowroot powder, or more coconut flour*
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
10 1/2 tablespoons grass-fed unsalted butter at room temperature
7-9 tablespoons golden erythritol to taste (we use 7TBS)
1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses totally optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
3 oz Lily's Sweets dark chocolate bar broken up (or chips)
2 1/2 ounces pecans broken up
flakey sea salt to garnish

INSTRUCTIONS
Please see video for reference, tips 'n tricks! It's for the double chocolate version, but honestly same difference (just without the cocoa & slightly different ratios!).

Add almond flour, coconut flour, konjac powder (or arrowroot/more coconut flour), salt, baking soda and xanthan gum to a medium bowl. Whisk until thoroughly combined and set aside.

Cream butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until softened, 1-2 minutes. Add in sweetener and molasses (optional), and continue to cream until light and fluffy (about 8 minutes).

Add in vanilla extract and egg, mixing until just incorporated. The mixture will appear slightly 'broken' (i.e. not thoroughly smooth). 

With your mixer on low, add in half of your flour mixture- mixing until just incorporated. Mix in the rest.

Fold in chocolate and pecan bits. Cover with cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper (if you use a silpat baking mat they won't spread much, if at all).

Divide cookie dough into 18 rounds for 3 1/2-inch cookies (or 12 for jumbo style!), and flatten them slightly. The cookies will spread somewhat during baking, but you still need to pre-shape them slightly (i.e. the more you pre-flatten them the more they'll spread = crispier cookies, so if you like them cakier just don't flatten them too much!). 

Place cookie dough on the prepared baking tray (or freeze, see notes). Bake for 9-10 minutes for smaller cookies and 12-13 minutes for the jumbo, flipping tray around 180° half way through.

Garnish with flakey sea salt and allow the cookies to cool completely on the trays (sugar alcohols can take a few hours to crisp up, so don't despair!). Store in an airtight container for three to four days.
